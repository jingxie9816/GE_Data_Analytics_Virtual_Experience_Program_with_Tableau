# GE_Digital_Technology_Data_Analytics_Virtual_Experience_Program
This is a virtual experience program, not a real internship, but I act as a data scientist in GE Aviation team to gain insights from dataset.

### The program background is:

At GE Aviation, they use the concept of a “Data Lake”. A Data Lake is a single database instance that contains data from all around Aviation. Everything from financial, delivery (of parts and engines), supplier, engine data, customer data, and so on.

The advantage of a Data Lake is that allows the developer to make a single connection string to the Data Lake, and as long as the developer has permissions to see the data – they are able to immediately start creating data-driven insights in a centralized repository of data.

### My task:

In order to assist the GE Aviation team to make decisions based off real time data, I have to do both data engineering and data visualization to drive meaningful insights using enterprise-grade technology.

### 1. Data Engineering

Create a single data set that combines all the data listed below into a single table:

- Flight data (so data relating to the health of the mechanical engine of a plane)
- Location Data for airports, Manufacturing Data (which relate to various airplane parts)
- Bill of material (which tells you what engines have been used)
- Manufacturing details

### 2. Data Visualization
